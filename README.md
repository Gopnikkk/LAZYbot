# LAZYbot

Discord bot operating in the House server http://dscrd.me/housechessvariants just to further lazy's understanding of basic js.
Written in js, run from Windows cmd Node. Visual Studio Code environment.

Functions extremely specific to server. So far it can:  

• react to certain phrases  
• handle basic arguments with " " spacers  
• handle two prefixes  
• convert plaintext subreddit comments (ex: /r/AskReddit) into hyperlinks, when posted alone in a comment  

Development ongoing!
