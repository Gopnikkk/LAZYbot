When loading your DB profile, the bot takes the first 'you' it comes across. So being higher up in the db means:\n\n• **Commands are slightly more likely to work for you.**\n\nIn addition to the other advantages:\n\n**• Can be seen when someone uses `!positions`.\n• Cool medal your profile `!profile`.\n• Better, more important, unique number.\n• 'Higher' than everyone else.**\n\nBasically, people with higher-up numbers are just *better*. There is a process to change your DB position.",
